    <description>Obviously based on a Garmin GTX-327. A transponder that is installed in many aircrafts. Buttons will light up when cockpit lighting is turned on.
Soon to be updated with clickable buttons and made compatible with FSX/P3D.

The transponder mode function differs between aircrafts. You might have to change the Lua script to get the correct mode displayed for your aircraft.

Current setting:
0 = OFF
1 = STBY
2 = ON (mode A) with reply mode (R) on
3 = ALT (mode C) with reply mode (R) on
4 = TST</description>
